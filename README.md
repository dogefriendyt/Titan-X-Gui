# Titan X

-- **Titan X**

Titan X is a free to use script gui for most games, sadly you have to manually choose the game it is you're in, but overall it works great!

If it lags, give it a minute.

Heres the script: ```loadstring(game:HttpGet('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0exo/Titan-X-Gui/main/menu.lua'))()```
